# Results from Grocery Pipeline

### Error Detection

The pipeline is able to detect rate limiting errors, OpenAI API quota errors, and when the user hasn't supplied Serper API keys, etc.

For example, when not supplied the Serper API keys, the pipeline will continue without the enriched web data, but emit the following error analysis at the end.
```markdown
Based on the provided context, here is the analysis of the errors currently being encountered in the pipeline:

1. **Errors Currently Encountered:**
   - **enrich_internal_data_with_web stage:** There is a global error with a code `500`, indicating an internal server error during the enrichment process.
   - **load_internal_data stage:** This stage also shows a global error with a code `500`, which is typically indicative of an internal server error.

2. **Common Patterns or Root Causes:**
   - **Internal Server Errors (500):** The consistent `500` error code suggests that there might be an issue on the server-side or within the pipeline logic that is causing the stages to fail during execution.
   - **Dependence on External Services:** The `enrich_internal_data_with_web` function relies on external services to fetch additional information, which can be prone to failures if the service is unavailable or there are issues with network connectivity or API changes.
   - **Data Dependencies and Schema Issues:** Stages like `clean_external_data` have strict schema requirements and data dependencies, which might lead to errors if the incoming data doesn't meet the expected schema or if there are missing critical values.

3. **Most Likely Causes of the Errors:**
   - **Issues with External Services or APIs:** Given that `enrich_internal_data_with_web` relies on the `SearchSerperAgent.run`, any issues with network connectivity, API availability, or response handling can cause this stage to fail.
   - **Data Handling and Processing:** Errors in data processing, such as handling empty data frames or missing critical columns, can lead to failures. For instance, if the initial data fetched is incomplete or incorrect, subsequent processing stages may encounter errors.
   - **Code Exceptions and Error Handling:** Unhandled exceptions or incorrect error handling can also lead to `500` errors. There might be underlying exceptions that are not properly caught or resolved within the pipeline implementation, leading to a cascade of failures.

Overall, it seems like the pipeline is encountering issues related to external dependencies, data integrity, and error handling, which are manifesting as internal server errors during the execution of certain stages.
